"""Decide, from health history, which sources are actually broken.

A single red tells you almost nothing. Icelandic public APIs blink; a probe that
fails at 06:17 and passes at 06:17 tomorrow was a flake, and paging on it is how
a monitor teaches you to ignore it. So the gate is a *verdict over history*, not
over today:

    dead    — 3+ consecutive non-healthy observations (infra: unreachable/sick)
    broken  — 2+ consecutive *structural* failures: the service answered and
              answered wrong. Schema drift, expired dashboard id, revoked key.
              The skill is now lying about the source, and needs updating.
    flaky   — failed within the window but recovered; recorded, not actionable
    healthy — clean across the window
    unknown — too few observations to judge yet

Structural failures convict faster than infra ones because they essentially
never self-heal: a service healthy enough to fail your assertion is a service
that is up and has changed.

Streaks count *consecutive observations*, never calendar days. GitHub documents
that scheduled runs can be dropped entirely, so a gap means "not observed", not
"down" — and uptime is healthy/observed, never healthy/elapsed.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/health_verdict.py --history health/history.jsonl
    uv run python scripts/health_verdict.py --history h.jsonl --markdown "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"

Exits non-zero when any source is dead or broken.
